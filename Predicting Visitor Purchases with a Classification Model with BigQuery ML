-- Results
-- Of the top 6% of first-time visitors (sorted in decreasing order of predicted probability), more than 6% make a purchase in a later visit.

-- These users represent nearly 50% of all first-time visitors who make a purchase in a later visit.

-- Overall, only 0.7% of first-time visitors make a purchase in a later visit.

-- Targeting the top 6% of first-time increases marketing ROI by 9x vs targeting them all!
